This is a web programming project that I did in a C# class. This site has multiple pages that showcase different features. 
Features are listed in order of page lineage:
 - Donny's Vehicles -> Displaying vehicles that are in the session when the page loads(Stored as Donny's vehicles)
 - Donny's Vehicles -> Also displays a random vehicle from the session and displays a corresponding image
 - Save Your Own Vehicle -> Allow a user to save a vehicle of their own to the session
 - Show Saved Vehicles -> Display vehicles that the user has saved
 - Select a Favorite -> Select favorite vehicles to the session
 - Show Your Favorites -> Display favorite vehicles that were saved to the session
 - Upload an Image -> Upload a picture of a vehicle.

To run this code in Visual Studio:
 - Copy URL from the code on this github page
 - Clone repository in Visual Studio with URL
 - When project opens, set Start_Page.aspx as start page
 - Page will respond with an error if you don't specify a start page
