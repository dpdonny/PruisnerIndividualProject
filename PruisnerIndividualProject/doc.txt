If this setting doesn't transfer when I zip the file, make sure that Start_Page.aspx is set as the start page




My project topic is vehicle customization. My goal is to create an interactive web page that allows a user to customize a vehicle of their choosing. The options for the page may be limited since there are way more vehicle options than I have the time or energy to think about including. 

The contents of my page require the following: 
	1 main page
	3 Form pages
	3 Display pages
	Navigation between pages
	1 Master page
	1 Documentation file(This file)



My pages:

	Main page: Start_Page.aspx
		This page is the start page and explains the purpose and features of the website. 
	
	Content:

		selector.aspx
			This page displays vehicles that are saved in the array as well as a random vehicle and image from the initial array. 
		user_display.aspx
			This page displays all of the vehicles that the user has saved to the session. Also shows any images that the user has uploaded
		favorite_display.aspx
			This page displays the favorites that the user has selected
	
	Forms:

		entry.aspx
			This page allows a user to save a vehicle that they own or are interested in.
		favorite.aspx
			This page allows a user to select either their own vehicle or one of the initiated vehicles as their "favorite"
		upload.aspx
			This page allows a user to upload an image to the website. It saves the file path in the session and then uses that file path in the user_disply.aspx page to display the image.
		

	Header and navigation are on the master page.
